# ulauncher-stardict-lookup

An extension for [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) for looking up definitions in StarDict dictionaries.

Note that the extension does not come with any StarDict dictionaries. 

The user has to download the StarDict dictionaries separately and set their path in 'Dictionary path' in the extension's preferences.

The extension uses [pystardict](https://github.com/lig/pystardict/) under the hood.
